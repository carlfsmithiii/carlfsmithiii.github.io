                <h2>A bit about me</h2>
                <p>I studied
                    <strong>classical guitar performance</strong> at Ball State University before working for a local municipality
                    where I gained experience in building maintenance and HVAC. I went on to work as an HVAC controls technician,
                    which was a blast! However, with a firm goal to become a software developer, I completed bachelor's degrees
                    in
                    <strong>Math</strong> through Indiana University and
                    <strong>Software Development</strong> through Western Governor's University. I currently study at Kenzie Academy,
                    a code academy in Indianapolis, IN. </p>

                <h2>Current status as a developer</h2>
                <p>For the near future, much of the code found in my repositories will be learning exercises, but hopefully
                    some real projects will take seed soon.</p>

                <h2>Aspirational / Goals</h2>
                <p>I am working to gain a profiency in building solutions that leverage the architecture of the web. I know
                    that is vague and corny, but give me a few months and I'll have better specifics. I also hope to learn
                    to develop attractive websites, so expect to see some improvements to this page's appearance over the
                    coming weeks.</p>
                <h3>Projects that I hope to become involved with:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.freebsd.org" alt "FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a> -- I admire the community around FreeBSD and hope to become involved in the project.</li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.inpaws.org" alt="Indiana Native Plant and Wilflower Society" title="Indiana Native Plant and Wildflower Society">INPAWS</a> -- It's not
                        <em>just</em> about flowers! Ecological carrying capacity relies on the relationships between plants
                        and insects, which makes native plants a foundation for the entire environment.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>MORE -- In many ways, I am seeking my muse. While I have ideas of what I want to do, I suspect I will
                        find a different path than I am able to imagine.</li>
