    <h2>A bit about me</h2>
    <p>I studied classical guitar performance at Ball State University before working for a local municipality where I gained experience in building maintenance and HVAC.  I went on to work as an HVAC controls technician, which was a blast!  However, with a firm goal to become a software developer, I completed bachelor's degrees in Math through Indiana University and Software Development through Western Governor's University.  I currently study at Kenzie Academy, a code academy in Indianapolis, IN.  </p>

    <h2>Current status</h2>
    <p>For the near future, much of the code found in my repositories will be learning exercises, but hopefully some real projects will take seed soon.</p>
    <h2>Aspirational Goals</h2>
    <p>I am working to gain a profiency in building solutions that leverage the architecture of the web.  I know that is vague and corny, but give me a few months and I'll have better specifics.</p>
    <h3>Projects that I hope to become involved with:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.freebsd.org" alt"FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a> -- I admire the community around FreeBSD and hope to become involved in the project.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.inpaws.org" alt="Indiana Native Plant and Wilflower Society" title="Indiana Native Plant and Wildflower Society">INPAWS</a> -- It's not <em>just</em> about flowers!  Ecological carrying capacity relies on the relationships between plants and insects, which makes native plants a foundation for the entire environment.</em></li>
        <li>MORE -- In many ways, I am seeking my muse.  While I have ideas of what I want to do, I suspect I will find a different path than I am able to imagine.</li>
    </ul>
