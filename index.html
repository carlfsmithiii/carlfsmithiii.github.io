    <h1>Carl Smith's GitHub</h1>
    <h2>Current status</h2>
    <p>I am studying full stack web development and software development through Kenzie Academy in Indianapolis, IN.  Much of the code found in my repositories will be learning exercises.  Hopefully, however, some real projects will take seed as well.</p>
    <h2>Aspirational Goals</h2>
    <p>I am hoping to gain a profiency in building solutions that leverage the architecture of the web.  I know that is vague and corny, but give me a few months and I'll have better specifics.</p>
    <h3>Projects that I hope to become involved with:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>FreeBSD</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.inpaws.org" alt="Indiana Native Plant and Wilflower Society" title="Indiana Native Plant and Wildflower Society">INPAWS</a></li>
    </ul>
